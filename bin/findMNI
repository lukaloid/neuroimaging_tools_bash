# DESCRIPTION:
# this tiny function fetches the path of the average MNI brain
# used in several homegrown scripts
# can change in different FSL releases, hence the function (which may itself need to be changed)
# more robust route would be a find command, but that's too slow

Usage: findMNI [<r>]
Options:
  <r> indicates the resolution:

      if <r> is \"5\", \".5\", \"-.5\", \"-.5mm\", etc., find .5mm resolution MNI
      if no <r> is given, find 2mm resolution MNI
